# Paper Protocol üßª

## Paper What?üôÑ

Paper Protocol is a project that make your hold unstoppable. If you commited, if you are a believer there is no step back. Either hold to your goal or go with noting. And you know what? Paper Protocol with gelp you HODL to the end. Our main purpose is to hold your ETH until target price is reached. If target price is not reached you will still hold. If current price is going lower and lower you will still hold. If your ETH price becomes 0... well... the only thing you will have is belife, your dead HODL and AMAZING NFT that would remind you every day that you are a HODLer.

## Too much? Ok, let's go slower

The core of protocol is smart contracts. Main smart contract allows you to lock assets until asset target price is reached. In return you will receive dynamic generated NFT that represents your lock and how cool you are.

### How cool am I?

Your coolnes depends on how strong your beliefe is. The more you believer the better grade NFT you get. There are few tiers of NFTs that corresponds to target price of your position (the bigger the collerüòé). Here are all tier grades:

- üßª Paper Hands Tier - if your ETH target price is less than 5000$ than you are a believer but not very big. One day you believe eth will be 4000$ but after one Trump tweet you want to sell it, so to not sell it you lock it.
- üí™ Smart Hands Tier - if target price is less than 7000$ than you are a smart person. You believe ETH will have very good near future but sometimes you are still tempting to sell it. Smart move for smart person to HODL.
- ü¶æ Strong Hands Tier - if target price is less than 10000$ than you are a strong - you have strong arms to press DEPOSIT and strong belief that ETH will perform greately.
- üí™ Diamond Hands Tier - for target price bigger than 10000$. Let's say that you are either Vitalik, Rostik, ultra super mega strong believer or some unimaginable pshyco that would lock money for half a century. I mean if it works it worksü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è... If Paper Protocol allows you to not worry about "accidental" ETH sell than we did great job of building it.

### So when Im allowed to get my precious ETH back?

When ETH reaches target price you can withdraw your assets. And as memory you will only have your NFT with your (ETH) old goals (target price).

## About Art

All NFTs are a peice of art, each one is true DeFi stuff and stored fully on chain. SVG is generated using user deposit data which also determines it's tier and all that converts into good looling NFT with all necessary metadata.

## How to interact with protocol?

Good job, now every day you will pray to Blockchain gods so they boost ETH price so you can unite with your priceless virtual currency again. Also while you are filling deposit form you can see at the same time amazing NFT you will get for your deposit.

## One more thing

Of course thats not all. You are not alone in this journey of edjing SELL button with inability to click it because your funds are locked. There are other people that lock their ETH so they hold it with guarantee. So specially for all of you there is [leaderboard](https://paper-protocol.vercel.app/believer-index) that shows how degen you are. This table shows rating of wallets, how much ETH they locked, their position in rating and **Believer Index**. This index is calculated by formula `amount * target_price` where `amount` is amount of ETH locked and `target_price` is target price of the position. The more you deposit with huge target - the more believer you are. But don't overcommit because... you know what?... forget it, commit more that you can, believe more than your imagination allows!
